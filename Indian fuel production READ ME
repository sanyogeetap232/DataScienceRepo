Indian fuel production.pbix: This Visualization looks at the Production and revenue value of fuels from the year 2000 to 2015 in India. First Page:

The first page of the visualization shows the production of the fuels across the years 2000 to 2015.
We can see that there is a steady rise in the production of coal since 2000 and the production has increased 50% till 2015.
We can also see a slight increase in the production of lignite over the years.
Whereas the production of petroleum has shown no significant increase in its production since 2000 (we might think that there should have been an increase in petroleum production given the day by day increase in petroleum use in India but the graph does not show any significant increase. This might be due to several different reasons and a further investigation is needed to find out the "Why's" behind it. 

Second Page:
Second page shows the value of fuels across the years 2000 to 2015.
Given the difference between the production quantities of coal and petroleum and the Value differences we can conclude though the production of coal is significantly more than petroleum, the revenue generated by petroleum is almost same as that of coal. 

Third Page:
Third page shows the comparison of production amount and value generated by petroleum in India across the years 2000-2015.
The graph shows that there was a sharp rise in the value of petroleum in the years 2007-2008 to 2008-2009, there can be various reason behind this rise which would need other fields to signify the rise.
Also the graph shows a slight decrease in the value from the year 2013-2014 to 2014-2015
